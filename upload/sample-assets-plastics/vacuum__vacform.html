<h1>Vacuum Forming</h1>

<p>This process is used to manufacture a variety of products in
thermoplastic materials. Products range in size from garden pond liners to food trays used in supermarkets. A typical industrial size vacuum forming machine like the one below is capable of producing vacuum formings up to 1.8m x 1.5m in size.</p>

<p><a href="programme-assets/images/v1mach2.jpg" class="popup"><img class="picleft" src="./programme-assets/images/v1mach2.jpg" width="321"></a></p>

<p>A mould, like the one below, for producing the interior panels of lorry cabs, is attached to a platen (support plate).</p>

<p style="clear:left"></p>

<p><a href="programme-assets/images/v1clamp.jpg" class="popup"><img class="picleft" src="./programme-assets/images/v1clamp.jpg" width="321"></a></p>

<p>The platen and mould are then lowered and rigid thermoplastic sheet material is clamped onto an air-tight gasket and usually heated from above. Once the
thermoplastic sheet is softened enough (i.e. reaches a plastic state), air is blown in to raise the sheet in a slight bubble before the platen is raised bringing the mould into contact with the plastic. Any trapped air remaining between the platen and the heated plastic sheet is then evacuated by a vacuum pump. Atmospheric pressure acting over the top surface completes the forming process by pressing the plastic sheet onto the mould.</p>

<p style="clear:left"></p>

<p>Once the plastic sheet has cooled down to below it's freeze point the air flow is reversed to lift the forming off the mould. If this is not done quickly the forming tends to grip onto the mould and attempts to prise them apart often result in damage to the forming.

<h2>Heater Systems</h2>
<p>Electrically powered ceramic heating elements are usually mounted
under a heater hood which is attached to the forming machine. Heat from these
elements is directed down onto the thermoplastic sheet in order to soften it in
readiness for vacuum forming. Groups or zones of heaters are controlled
separately by a power regulator so that fine adjustment of output is possible within each zone. This is to compensate for variations in heat loss such as around the heater edges. Some industrial machines can heat the thermoplastic sheet from both sides which can reduce heating times by up to 60%.</p>

<p style="clear:left"></p>

<h2>Forming Pressure</h2>
<p>The vacuum pump can be connected directly to the platen in small and
medium size machines. Larger machines may operate the vacuum pump during the heating cycle to evacuate a reservoir prior to removing air from the space between the mould and the softened thermoplastic sheet. The extra evacuated volume in the reservoir ensures that the air between the mould and the softened plastic sheet is evacuated quickly.</p>

<p>The limiting factor of the vacuum forming process is that the forming
pressure cannot be greater than atmospheric pressure (14.7psi or 1 bar). This can cause problems when high definition mouldings are required in thermoplastic materials which have poor plasticity properties. This problem is overcome by using a process called Vacuum/Pressure Forming. In this process a pressure chamber is sealed over the top of the hot plastic sheet and compressed air is pumped in to increase the forming pressure to above atmospheric pressure.</p>

<h2>Trimming</h2>
<p>Several methods can be used to remove waste material from the final
product. For low volume quantities of vacuum formings a slitting saw can be used. For high volume quantities a clipping press can be used with thin sheet material and for thicker mouldings, hand held or CNC (computer numerically
controlled) routers are used. The photo shows an ABS vacuum forming of a display
sign prior to trimming.</p>
